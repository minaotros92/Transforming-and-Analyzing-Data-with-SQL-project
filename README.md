# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
1- use SQL to create table , columns , clean and organize data.
2- then analyze it to find important trends and insights.
3- the goal is to turn complex data into understandable information and share your Results. 
4- This project will test my skills in using SQL for data analysis and problem-solving.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

1) I downloaded the csv files and explored them in Excel to know what the data types and further my understanding of how the data is organized, 
2) I imported the data into pgadmin for further exploration and applied my sql knowledge
3) i create the column for every table and choose the right date type for it .
4) after i finished creating tables and choose the data type, i create file data backup in case some thing wrong happen while i worked
5) I attempted to understand the data and noted any data quality issues to clean it later
6) I noticed there was a lot of data and some tables difficult like all_sessions and analytics and  were some  better than others like products,sales_by_sku and sales_report
7) I read the “Starting with questions”  as the mentor advice us to guide me to understand the data
8) I decided to create a view of a CTE. I selected and cleaned relevant columns . 
9) I used the row number function to remove duplicates within the view.
10) I queried the views I created to answer various questions. 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)


This data had information regarding countries and cities, dates, prices, channel grouping, products, and units sold. It also had data about the time on site as well as some supply chain information like lead time. 

I used the data, after cleaning, to analyze revenue, orders, products, and channel grouping. My conclusions are below.

1) The United States is responsible for most of the revenue, occupying seven places in the top 10. 
2) The top 10 highest average order size was again dominated by the United States, although Canada and Japan were also present. It was interesting to see that the city with the highest revenue – Mountain View, United States – was ranked 10 for average order size.
3) It was difficult to determine a pattern for the product categories. A lot of it was my inability to properly clean the product categories to its main category.
4) Most of the orders were apparel items while electronics and Nest were second most.
5) Most of the site revenue was generated from unknown cities in the United States at over 10 percent.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

1) The size of the data files, especially the All Sessions and Analytics tables ,the data was very big
2) choosing the right data type while create the tables take some times
3) pgadmin crash many time while i work on analytics file.
4) write correct query without any mistaks . 
5) keep forget the squel query structure
5)  struggled with create ERD. 


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

1) Enhance Data Cleaning and Categorization Skills. 
2) Learn Advanced SQL and Database Management 
3) Explore More Advanced Analytics Techniques.
4) Continue Professional Development in Data Analysis.
